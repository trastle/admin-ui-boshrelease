# Bosh release for CloudFoundry NG Admin UI

One of the fastest ways to get [admin-ui](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/admin-ui) running on any infrastructure is too deploy this bosh release.

## Usage

To use this bosh release, first upload it to your bosh:

```
bosh target BOSH_URL
bosh login
git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/admin-ui-boshrelease.git
cd admin-ui-boshrelease
bosh upload release releases/admin-ui-1.yml
```

Now create a deployment file (using the files in examples as a starting point) and deploy:

```
bosh deployment path/to/deployment.yml
bosh deploy
```

## Create new final release

To create a new final release you need to get read/write API credentials to the [@cloudfoundry-community](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community) s3 account.

Please email [Dr Nic Williams](mailto:&#x64;&#x72;&#x6E;&#x69;&#x63;&#x77;&#x69;&#x6C;&#x6C;&#x69;&#x61;&#x6D;&#x73;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6D;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6C;&#x2E;&#x63;&#x6F;&#x6D;) and he will create unique API credentials for you.

Create a `config/private.yml` file with the following contents:

``` yaml
---
blobstore:
  s3:
    access_key_id:     ACCESS
    secret_access_key: PRIVATE
```

You can now create final releases for everyone to enjoy!

```
bosh create release
# test this dev release
git commit -m "updated redis"
bosh create release --final
git commit -m "creating vXYZ release"
git tag vXYZ
git push origin master --tags
```
